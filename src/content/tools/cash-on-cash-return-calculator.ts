## Understanding Cash-on-Cash Return

Cash-on-cash return is a key metric for real estate investors. It measures the annual return on the actual cash invested in a property. This is different from other metrics like ROI or cap rate because it focuses solely on the cash you put in, not the total value of the property.

### How to Calculate Cash-on-Cash Return

The formula for cash-on-cash return is:

**Cash-on-Cash Return = (Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) x 100%**

- **Annual Cash Flow:** This is your gross rental income minus all of your operating expenses and mortgage payments.
- **Total Cash Invested:** This includes your down payment, closing costs, and any renovation costs.

### Why is Cash-on-Cash Return Important?

This metric is important because it gives you a clear picture of the performance of your investment based on the cash you have personally invested. It helps you compare different investment opportunities and make informed decisions.

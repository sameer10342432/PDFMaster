    title: 'Contingency Removal Deadline Tracker: Never Miss a Critical Deadline',
    content: `
Contingency deadlines are critical checkpoints in real estate transactions. Missing a removal deadline can jeopardize the entire deal or result in the loss of earnest money.

### What Are Contingencies?

Contingencies are conditions that must be met for the purchase contract to become binding and proceed to closing. They protect buyers by allowing contract cancellation if certain conditions aren't satisfied.

**Why Contingencies Matter:**
- Protect buyer's earnest money deposit
- Allow buyers to back out without penalty
- Provide negotiation leverage
- Ensure property meets expectations
- Verify financing availability

**Contingency vs Contingency Removal:**
- Contingency = Buyer's right to cancel contract
- Removal = Buyer waives right to cancel
- Before removal = Buyer can cancel and get deposit back
- After removal = Buyer loses deposit if they cancel

### Primary Contingencies & Their Deadlines

**1. Inspection Contingency (7-14 days typical)**

**Purpose:** Allows buyer to inspect property and negotiate repairs or cancel contract.

**Timeline:**
- Day 1-3: Schedule professional home inspection
- Day 3-5: Inspection performed
- Day 5-7: Receive inspection report
- Day 7-10: Review with agent, get contractor estimates
- Day 10-12: Submit repair request or cancel
- Day 12-14: Deadline to remove or renegotiate

**What Triggers Removal:**
- ✓ Satisfactory inspection with no major issues
- ✓ Seller agrees to requested repairs
- ✓ Buyer accepts property "as-is" after inspection
- ✓ Negotiated price reduction in lieu of repairs

**What Prevents Removal:**
- ✗ Major structural issues discovered
- ✗ Seller refuses reasonable repair requests
- ✗ Inspection reveals deal-breaker problems
- ✗ Repair costs exceed buyer's budget

**Action Required:**
- Sign inspection contingency removal form
- Submit to seller's agent by deadline
- Keep copy for your records
- Cannot be revoked once signed

**2. Appraisal Contingency (14-21 days typical)**

**At or Above Purchase Price:**

**Options When Appraisal Is Low:**
1. Seller reduces price to appraised value

Successfully managing contingency deadlines protects your earnest money, maintains good faith with the seller, and ensures a smooth path to closing. Use digital reminders, maintain communication with all parties, and never remove a contingency until you're completely satisfied with that aspect of the transaction.

    <h2>Coast FIRE with Real Estate: Let Your Properties Do the Work</h2>
    <p>Coast FIRE means reaching a point where your investments will grow to support retirement without adding more money. Real estate is perfect for Coast FIRE because properties appreciate and mortgages get paid down by tenants.</p>
    
    <h3>What is Coast FIRE?</h3>
    <p>Coast FIRE is when you've saved enough that your investments will grow to a sufficient retirement nest egg without additional contributions. You "coast" to retirement, working only to cover current expenses.</p>
    
    <h3>Coast FIRE Formula</h3>
    <p>Traditional: Coast FIRE Number = Retirement Goal ÷ (1 + Return Rate)^Years to Retirement</p>
    <p>Real Estate: Properties + Equity Growth + Appreciation = Retirement Goal at Age 65</p>
    
    <h3>Why Real Estate is Perfect for Coast FIRE</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dual Growth:</strong> Property appreciation + mortgage paydown</li>
      <li><strong>Tenant-Paid Equity:</strong> Renters pay off your loans while you coast</li>
      <li><strong>Forced Savings:</strong> Mortgage paydown happens automatically</li>
      <li><strong>Inflation Protection:</strong> Values and rents increase over time</li>
      <li><strong>Passive Cash Flow:</strong> Income during retirement</li>
      <li><strong>Lower Risk:</strong> Tangible assets with steady tenants</li>
    </ul>

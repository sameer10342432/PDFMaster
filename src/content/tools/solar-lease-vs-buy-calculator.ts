### Solar Loan vs Lease: The Real Comparison

**Solar Loan Advantages over Lease:**
- Same $0 down
- You own the system
- Get 30% tax credit
- Better long-term savings
- Adds home value
- Monthly payment similar or lower
- Fixed payment (no escalators)
- Loan ends (free power after)
- Better for home sale

**Why Solar Loan Beats Lease:**
- After 20 years: Lease still paying, loan is paid off
- Years 21-25: Pure savings with loan, still paying lease
- Lifetime savings 2-3x better with loan
- Home value increase with loan only

### When Leasing Might Make Sense

**Rare Valid Scenarios:**

1. **Short-Term Homeowner (< 5 years)**
   - Moving soon anyway
   - Won't recoup buying cost
   - Immediate savings desired
   - Lease may be acceptable

2. **Zero Tax Liability**
   - Retired with no income
   - Can't use federal credit
   - Lease company benefits instead
   - Still better to buy if possible

3. **Terrible Credit (Can't Get Loan)**
   - No access to financing
   - Can't pay cash
   - Lease only solar option
   - Better than no solar

4. **Zero Maintenance Desire**
   - Don't want any responsibility
   - Value complete hands-off
   - Willing to pay premium for service
   - Still questionable value

### Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)

**What Is a PPA:**
- Similar to lease but different payment
- Pay per kWh produced (not fixed monthly)
- Company owns system
- No upfront cost
- Slightly better than lease, worse than buying

**PPA vs Lease:**
- Lease: Fixed monthly payment
- PPA: Pay per production (variable)
- Both: No ownership
- Both: Company gets tax credits
- Both: Complicate home sale

**PPA Pros:**
- Only pay for power produced
- Lower risk if system underperforms
- Slight savings vs utility

**PPA Cons:**
- Still no ownership
- Still no tax credits
- Still worse than buying
- Rate escalators still apply
- Still complicates home sale

### Breaking Down the Math

**True Cost of Leasing:**

**Lease Payments:**
- Year 1-5: $100/month × 60 = $6,000
- Year 6-10: $113/month × 60 = $6,780
- Year 11-15: $127/month × 60 = $7,620
- Year 16-20: $143/month × 60 = $8,580
- Year 21-25: $161/month × 60 = $9,660
- **Total paid: $38,640**

**Opportunity Cost:**
- Could have bought for: $11,600 (net)
- Paid for lease instead: $38,640
- **Extra paid: $27,040**

**Lost Benefits:**
- No tax credit: -$5,400
- No home value increase: -$16,000
- No SREC income: -$5,000 (where applicable)
- **Total lost benefits: $26,400**

**True Cost of Lease vs Buy:**
- Extra payments: $27,040
- Lost benefits: $26,400
- **Total disadvantage: $53,440**

### Buyout Options

**Most Leases Offer Buyout:**
- After 5-7 years typically
- Buyout price: Fair market value (often high)
- Or remaining payments discounted
- Usually not a good deal
- Better to buy from start

**Buyout Example:**
- Year 7 buyout price: $15,000
- Already paid: $7,500
- Total: $22,500
- Could have bought initially: $11,600
- Overpaid by: $10,900

### Impact on Home Sale

**Selling with Owned Solar:**
- Appraisal includes solar value
- Marketed as energy-efficient
- Attracts environmentally conscious buyers
- Homes sell 20% faster
- 4.1% price premium
- Clean transaction

**Selling with Leased Solar:**
- Buyer must qualify to assume lease
- Limits buyer pool (some refuse)
- Complicates closing process
- Requires lease company approval
- May negotiate lower price
- Extended time on market

**Lease Transfer Process:**
- Buyer applies with solar company
- Credit check required
- Must meet income requirements
- Transfer fee: $0-$500
- 2-4 weeks processing
- Can delay or kill sale

**Buyout Before Sale:**
- Pay remaining lease value
- Then sell as solar-owned
- Often $10,000-$25,000
- May be worth it for sale
- Difficult math

### Making the Decision

**Choose to BUY if:**
- ✓ Planning to stay 7+ years
- ✓ Have tax liability for credits
- ✓ Can afford or finance

**Best Overall Strategy:**
- First choice: Cash purchase
- Second choice: Solar loan with good rate
- Third choice: Home equity loan
- Fourth choice: PPA (if must)
- Last choice: Lease (avoid if possible)

### Maximizing Value When Buying

**Financing Tips:**
- Compare multiple solar loan offers
- Check home equity rates (often lower)
- Negotiate installation price
- Get multiple quotes
- Look for dealer fee waivers
- Time for maximum incentives

**Right-Sizing:**
- Match annual usage precisely
- Account for future EV charging
- Don't oversize system
- Optimize placement and orientation

**Quality Selection:**
- Tier 1 panels (better warranties)
- Quality inverters (longer life)
- Reputable installer
- Strong workmanship warranty

Choose ownership for maximum savings, home value increase, and financial freedom.

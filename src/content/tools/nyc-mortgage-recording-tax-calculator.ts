Financing a property purchase in New York City? Prepare to pay one of the highest mortgage recording taxes in the nation—1.8% to 1.925% of your loan amount. The NYC Mortgage Recording Tax (also called CIRT) can add $15,000-$50,000+ to your closing costs. This calculator helps you estimate this substantial expense.

## What is the NYC Mortgage Recording Tax?

The Mortgage Recording Tax is a tax levied by New York State and New York City on the recording (filing) of a mortgage on real property. In NYC, this tax is one of the largest closing costs for buyers using financing.

### Also Known As:
- **CIRT:** Combined Intangible Rate Tax
- **MRT:** Mortgage Recording Tax
- **Mortgage Tax**

### Who Pays?
**Buyer** (borrower) pays in almost all cases
- Paid at closing
- Based on **loan amount**, not purchase price
- Cannot be avoided if obtaining a mortgage

## When Mortgage Recording Tax Applies

### Subject to Tax
✅ Purchase mortgages (new home)
✅ Refinances (new mortgage on existing property)
✅ Home equity loans (additional lien)
✅ Construction loans
✅ Commercial mortgages (in NYC)
✅ Co-op share loans (in NYC, unlike most states)

### Exempt or Reduced
❌ Assumption of existing mortgage (no new recording)
❌ Mortgage modification (not a new loan)
❌ HELOC (under certain conditions, consult attorney)
❌ Reverse mortgages (may be exempt)

### Special Case: Co-ops
**Unique to NYC:** Co-op share loans are subject to mortgage recording tax
- Most states don't tax co-op loans (shares, not real estate)
- NYC treats co-op share loans like mortgages
- Same 1.8-1.925% rate applies

## Comparison to Other Closing Costs

### Typical NYC Buyer Closing Costs (Financed Purchase)

**$1,000,000 Purchase, $800,000 Loan (80% LTV):**

| Cost Item | Amount | % of Price |
|---|---|---|
| Mortgage Recording Tax | $15,400 | 1.54% |
| Mansion Tax (if ≥$1M) | $10,000 | 1.00% |
| Attorney Fees | $5,000 | 0.50% |
| Title Insurance | $4,000 | 0.40% |
| Bank Fees | $4,000 | 0.40% |
| Appraisal | $750 | 0.08% |
| Building Fees | $2,000 | 0.20% |
| **Total** | **$41,150** | **4.12%** |

**Mortgage Recording Tax = ~37% of total closing costs!**

## Cash Purchase vs. Financed Purchase

### Impact on Total Cost

**$1,000,000 Co-op Purchase Example:**

**Cash Purchase:**
- Mansion Tax: $10,000
- Attorney: $5,000
- Title: $4,000
- Misc: $2,000
- **Total: $21,000 (2.1%)**

**80% Financed ($800K Loan):**
- Mansion Tax: $10,000
- **Mortgage Recording Tax: $15,400**
- Attorney: $5,000
- Title: $4,000
- Bank Fees: $4,000
- Misc: $2,000
- **Total: $40,400 (4.0%)**

**Financing adds $19,400 (primarily MRT)** = 2.42% of down payment

### Is Cash Worth It to Avoid MRT?

**Considerations:**

**Pros of Financing (Despite MRT):**
✅ Preserve liquidity (keep cash for other investments)
✅ Mortgage interest deduction (up to $750K loan)
✅ Leverage/arbitrage (if investment returns > mortgage rate)
✅ Inflation erodes real loan cost over time

**Pros of Cash (Avoid MRT):**
✅ Save $15,000+ in mortgage recording tax
✅ No interest payments
✅ Stronger negotiating position
✅ No debt burden

**Break-Even Analysis:**

**$800,000 Loan:**
- MRT: $15,400
- Interest over 30 years (7%): ~$1,117,000
- **Total cost of financing: $1,132,400**

**Investment Alternative (Pay Cash):**
- Invest $800,000 elsewhere
- If returns > 7% annually, financing makes sense despite MRT
- If returns < 7%, cash purchase saves money

## Refinancing and Mortgage Recording Tax

### Bad News: Tax Applies Again
**Problem:** Refinancing = new mortgage recording = new MRT
**Impact:** Discourages refinancing in NYC vs. rest of country

### Refinance Example
**Original Loan (Purchase in 2020):**
- Loan: $800,000
- Rate: 3.5%
- MRT Paid: $15,400

**Refinance in 2024 (Lower Balance):**
- New Loan: $720,000
- Rate: 6.5%
- **MRT Due Again: $13,860**

**Total MRT Paid Over Ownership:** $29,260

### When Refinancing Makes Sense Despite MRT

**Calculate Break-Even:**
1. Monthly payment savings × Months owned
2. Subtract new MRT + closing costs
3. Determine how long to break even

**Example:**
- Monthly payment savings: $400
- New MRT + costs: $17,000
- **Break-even: 42.5 months** (3.5 years)
- If staying 5+ years, refinance makes sense

### Alternatives to Refinancing
**Mortgage Modification:**
- Negotiate with lender to modify existing loan
- No new mortgage = no MRT
- Rarely available, lenders prefer refinance

**HELOC or Second Mortgage:**
- Take out second lien instead of refinancing first
- Avoids MRT on first mortgage
- But may pay higher rates on HELOC

## Strategies to Minimize Mortgage Recording Tax

### Strategy 1: Larger Down Payment
**Tactic:** Put down 25-30% instead of 20%
**Benefit:** Smaller loan = lower MRT

**Example: $1M Purchase**
- 20% down: $800K loan, MRT = $15,400
- 30% down: $700K loan, MRT = $13,475
- **Savings: $1,925**

**Trade-Off:** Less cash on hand, less leverage

### Strategy 2: Negotiate at $500K Breakpoint
**Tactic:** Structure loan to stay under $500K if possible
**Benefit:** 1.80% rate instead of 1.925%

**Example: $650K Purchase**
- Option A: $520K loan (80% of $650K), MRT = $10,010
- Option B: $487,500 loan (75% of $650K), MRT = $8,775
- **Savings: $1,235 for $32,500 less borrowed**

**Trade-Off:** Higher down payment needed

### Strategy 3: Delay Refinancing
**Tactic:** Only refinance if savings clearly justify MRT
**Benefit:** Avoid paying MRT multiple times

**Rule of Thumb:** Don't refinance unless:
- Rate drops 1.5%+ (vs. 0.75% in other markets)
- Can recoup MRT within 3 years
- Plan to stay 5+ years

### Strategy 4: Negotiate Seller Credit
**Tactic:** In buyer's market, request seller credit toward closing costs
**Benefit:** Offsets MRT burden

**Example:**
- Negotiate $15,000 seller credit
- Use to offset MRT
- Effectively reduces purchase price

**Reality:** Difficult in NYC's competitive market

### Strategy 5: Consider Co-op vs. Condo
**Reality Check:** MRT applies to both
**NYC Exception:** Unlike most states, NYC taxes co-op share loans

**No Savings:** Cannot avoid MRT by choosing co-op

## Tax Deductibility

### Federal Income Tax
**NOT directly deductible**
- MRT is a closing cost, not an ongoing expense
- Different from property taxes (which are deductible)

**BUT: Can add to cost basis**
- Increases your cost basis in the property
- Reduces capital gains tax when you sell
- Small benefit years later

### State/Local Income Tax
**NOT deductible** on NY State or NYC returns

### Cost Basis Example
**Purchase:**
- Price: $1,000,000
- MRT: $15,400
- Cost Basis: $1,015,400

**Sell 10 Years Later:**
- Sale Price: $1,500,000
- Capital Gain: $484,600 (vs. $500,000 without MRT basis adjustment)
- Tax Savings: ~$3,850 (at 25% capital gains rate)

**Net Cost of MRT:** $11,550 (after future tax savings)

## Comparison to Other States/Cities

### NYC Mortgage Recording Tax (1.8-1.925%)
**Among the Highest in the Nation**

**Other High-Tax Jurisdictions:**
- Long Island, NY: 1.3-1.8%
- Miami-Dade, FL: 0.35-0.60%
- Pennsylvania: 2.0% (but usually split 50/50 buyer/seller)

**Most States/Cities: 0-0.25%** (minimal or none)

**NYC Impact on Affordability:**
- $15,000-$50,000 additional cash needed
- Discourages refinancing
- Reduces buyer purchasing power
- Favors cash buyers

## Recent Legislative Proposals

### Potential Changes Under Discussion
**Reform Ideas:**
1. Reduce rates to 1.0-1.5% (increase affordability)
2. Exempt first-time buyers (encourage homeownership)
3. Waive tax on "green" refinances (energy efficiency)
4. Exclude refinances under certain conditions

**Reality:** No major changes passed in recent years; tax remains

### Political Debate
**Arguments for Reduction:**
- Hurts affordability in expensive market
- Discourages refinancing (locks in higher rates)
- Drives buyers to cash purchases (reduces market access)

**Arguments Against Reduction:**
- Generates ~$800M annually for NYC
- Mainly affects luxury buyers (can afford it)
- Alternative revenue sources unclear

## Real-World Buyer Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Buyer, $700K Condo
**Purchase Price:** $700,000
**Down Payment (15%):** $105,000
**Loan Amount:** $595,000
**MRT (1.925%):** $11,453.75
**Mansion Tax:** $0 (under $1M)
**Total Closing Costs:** ~$28,000

**Impact:** MRT alone = 11% of down payment

### Scenario 2: Move-Up Buyer, $1.5M Co-op
**Purchase Price:** $1,500,000
**Down Payment (30%):** $450,000
**Loan Amount:** $1,050,000
**MRT (1.925%):** $20,212.50
**Mansion Tax:** $18,750
**Total Closing Costs:** ~$70,000

**Impact:** MRT = 4.5% of down payment

### Scenario 3: Luxury Buyer, $3M Condo (Cash)
**Purchase Price:** $3,000,000
**Down Payment:** 100% cash
**Loan Amount:** $0
**MRT:** $0 (no mortgage)
**Mansion Tax:** $45,000
**Total Closing Costs:** ~$70,000

**Impact:** Saves $57,750 in MRT by paying cash

## Using This Calculator

### Step 1: Determine Loan Amount
**Purchase Price:**
- Less down payment
- Equals loan amount

**Example:** $1M purchase, 20% down = $800K loan

### Step 2: Identify Rate Tier
- Under $500K: 1.800%
- $500K+: 1.925%

### Step 3: Calculate MRT
- Loan amount × Rate
- Add MERS fee ($30-$250)

### Step 4: Budget Total Closing Costs
- Add MRT to other costs:
  - Mansion Tax (if ≥$1M)
  - Attorney fees
  - Title insurance
  - Bank fees
  - Building fees

### Step 5: Compare Financing vs. Cash
- Calculate MRT savings if paying cash
- Weigh against opportunity cost of tying up cash
- Consider mortgage interest deduction benefit

## Conclusion

The NYC Mortgage Recording Tax is one of the most expensive closing costs for financed property purchases, adding 1.8% to 1.925% of your loan amount—often $10,000 to $50,000+—to your upfront costs. Unlike most closing costs, MRT applies again if you refinance, making rate reductions less attractive in NYC than elsewhere.

Key Takeaways:
- **Expensive:** 1.8-1.925% of loan amount (among highest in nation)
- **Buyer pays:** Due at closing, can't be avoided with financing
- **Applies to refinances:** Discourages refinancing vs. other markets
- **Breakpoint strategy:** Stay under $500K loan if possible (1.80% vs. 1.925%)
- **Cash advantage:** Avoiding MRT is one reason cash buyers are so competitive in NYC

Use this calculator to estimate your MRT accurately and budget for total closing costs, ensuring you have sufficient funds for your NYC property purchase.

### Next Steps

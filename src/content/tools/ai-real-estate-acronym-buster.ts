      <h3>Common Misunderstandings Explained</h3>

      <p><strong>APR:</strong> Total cost including interest PLUS fees, points, and other charges</p>

      <p><strong>Sale Price:</strong> Agreed purchase price between buyer and seller</p>
      <p><strong>Appraised Value:</strong> Professional estimate of market value</p>
      <p>These three numbers are often different and all matter.</p>

      <h3>Real Estate Slang & Euphemisms</h3>
      <p>Agents use code words in listings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"Cozy"</strong> = Small</li>
        <li><strong>"TLC needed"</strong> = Requires significant repairs</li>
        <li><strong>"Fixer-upper"</strong> = Needs major renovation</li>
        <li><strong>"Vintage charm"</strong> = Old, possibly outdated</li>
        <li><strong>"Opportunity"</strong> = Has problems</li>
        <li><strong>"Unique"</strong> = Unusual layout or features (not always good)</li>
        <li><strong>"Up and coming"</strong> = Neighborhood improving but not there yet</li>
        <li><strong>"Motivated seller"</strong> = May accept lower offers</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Document Acronyms</h3>
      <p>Common in real estate paperwork:</p>

        <li><strong>CDA</strong> - Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure Agreement</li>

    <h2>Why Upgrade to Smart LED Bulbs?</h2>
    <p>Smart LED bulbs combine the energy efficiency of LEDs (75-85% less energy than incandescent) with WiFi connectivity, voice control, scheduling, and color-changing capabilities. While standard LED bulbs cost $2-$8, smart LEDs run $10-$50 per bulb, but the automation features reduce wasted lighting by an additional 20-40% beyond LED efficiency alone. A typical home replacing 20 bulbs saves $200-$400 annually on electricity, recouping the $200-$600 smart bulb investment in 18-36 months. Utility rebates of $1-$5 per bulb further improve ROI.</p>

    <h2>What is Cash Flow?</h2>
    <p>Cash flow is a key indicator of a rental property's financial performance. Positive cash flow means you have money left over after all expenses are paid, while negative cash flow indicates a loss. To accurately analyze cash flow, you must account for all sources of income and all expenses, including vacancies, maintenance, and property management fees.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Reasonable Accommodation Requirements</h2>
      <p>The Fair Housing Act (FHA) requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services when necessary to afford persons with disabilities equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. This legal obligation represents one of the most complex and consequential areas of housing law, where well-intentioned mistakes can result in federal lawsuits, HUD complaints, substantial damages, and civil rights violations on your record.</p>

      <p>A reasonable accommodation request occurs when a tenant or applicant with a disability asks for an exception to property rules or policies necessary because of their disability. Common examples include requests for assistance animals despite no-pet policies, requests for assigned parking spaces despite first-come policies, requests for live-in aides despite occupancy limits, or requests for lease modifications to accommodate disabilities. Understanding how to properly evaluate and respond to these requests is essential for legal compliance and protecting tenants' civil rights.</p>

      <h3>Legal Framework: Fair Housing Act and ADA</h3>
      <p>Two primary federal laws govern reasonable accommodation obligations, with state and local laws often providing additional protections:</p>

      <h4>Fair Housing Act (FHA)</h4>
      <p><strong>Coverage:</strong> The FHA applies to virtually all residential housing, including rental housing, condominiums, homeowners associations, cooperative housing, and most housing operated by religious organizations or private clubs. Very limited exceptions exist for owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units and single-family homes sold or rented without a broker.</p>

      <p><strong>Protected Class:</strong> The FHA prohibits discrimination based on disability, defined as: (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, (2) a record of such impairment, or (3) being regarded as having such impairment. This broad definition encompasses a wide range of disabilities beyond those visible or commonly recognized.</p>

      <p><strong>Accommodation Duty:</strong> Housing providers must make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a person with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, unless doing so would constitute an undue financial and administrative burden or fundamentally alter the nature of the provider's operations.</p>

      <p><strong>No-Fee Requirement:</strong> Housing providers cannot charge fees for processing or granting reasonable accommodation requests. The accommodation itself must be provided at no cost to the tenant, though who pays for physical modifications (reasonable modifications) follows different rules.</p>

      <h4>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h4>
      <p><strong>Application to Housing:</strong> The ADA primarily governs public accommodations and commercial facilities. It applies to housing only in limited circumstances, such as public or government-operated housing, commercial facilities within mixed-use buildings, or rental offices open to the public.</p>

      <p><strong>Complementary Standards:</strong> Where both FHA and ADA apply, providers must comply with both statutes. The ADA may impose additional accessibility requirements for public spaces within residential properties (leasing offices, common areas open to the public).</p>

      <h4>State and Local Laws</h4>
      <p>Many states and municipalities provide broader disability protections than federal law, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expanded disability definitions covering more conditions</li>
        <li>Lower standards for establishing disability status</li>
        <li>Additional protected characteristics (e.g., emotional support animal rights)</li>
        <li>Stricter landlord obligations and penalties</li>
        <li>Different procedural requirements for requests and responses</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Always comply with the law providing the greatest protection to individuals with disabilities.</p>

      <h3>Qualifying for Reasonable Accommodation</h3>
      <p>To establish entitlement to reasonable accommodation, three elements must be present:</p>

      <h4>1. Individual with a Disability</h4>
      <p><strong>Physical Impairments:</strong> Conditions substantially limiting major life activities such as walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, caring for oneself, or performing manual tasks. Examples include mobility impairments, vision or hearing loss, epilepsy, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and many others.</p>

      <p><strong>Mental Impairments:</strong> Psychiatric and developmental disabilities substantially limiting major life activities, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and intellectual disabilities. Mental impairments receive equal protection as physical disabilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Substantial Limitation Standard:</strong> The impairment must substantially limit (not completely prevent) one or more major life activities. This is a lower threshold than many people assume—temporary conditions or those in remission may still qualify.</p>

      <p><strong>Not Required to Be Obvious:</strong> Disabilities need not be visible or apparent. Many qualifying disabilities are invisible, including many mental health conditions, chronic pain, fatigue disorders, and internal medical conditions.</p>

      <h4>2. Nexus Between Disability and Requested Accommodation</h4>
      <p><strong>Connection Requirement:</strong> The requested accommodation must relate to the individual's disability. There must be a logical connection between the disability and how the requested accommodation addresses disability-related limitations.</p>

      <p><strong>Not Necessarily Obvious Connections:</strong> The nexus may not be immediately apparent to non-medical professionals. For example, the connection between PTSD and needing an emotional support animal, or between chronic pain and needing an assigned parking space, may not be obvious but can be legitimate.</p>

      <p><strong>Verification Process:</strong> When the disability or nexus is not readily apparent, housing providers may request reliable disability-related information from qualified healthcare providers. However, providers cannot demand specific diagnoses, medical records, or intrusive medical documentation.</p>

      <h4>3. Necessity for Equal Access/Enjoyment</h4>
      <p><strong>Equal Opportunity Requirement:</strong> The accommodation must be necessary to provide the individual with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling. "Necessary" means the accommodation must address disability-related limitations, not merely provide convenience or preference.</p>

      <p><strong>Not Requiring Perfection:</strong> The accommodation need not be the only possible solution or the best solution—just an effective one that addresses the disability-related need. Tenants may prefer one accommodation over another equivalent option, but providers can sometimes offer effective alternatives.</p>

      <p><strong>Individual Assessment:</strong> Necessity is evaluated individually based on the specific person's disability and circumstances, not based on assumptions about disabilities generally or what other people with similar disabilities might need.</p>

      <h3>Common Reasonable Accommodation Requests</h3>
      <p>While accommodation requests vary widely, certain categories appear frequently:</p>

      <h4>Assistance Animals</h4>
      <p><strong>Most Common Request:</strong> Assistance animal requests—both service animals and emotional support animals—represent the vast majority of reasonable accommodation requests housing providers receive.</p>

      <p><strong>Service Animals:</strong> Animals (typically dogs) individually trained to perform tasks or work for persons with disabilities. Service animals have broad access rights under ADA and FHA, and housing providers have very limited ability to deny them.</p>

      <p><strong>Emotional Support Animals:</strong> Animals providing emotional support, comfort, or companionship that alleviates symptoms of a person's disability. Unlike service animals, emotional support animals need not be trained, can be species other than dogs, and are protected only in housing (not public accommodations) under FHA.</p>

      <p><strong>Distinction from Pets:</strong> Assistance animals are not pets. No-pet policies, pet fees, pet deposits, or breed/size/species restrictions do not apply to legitimate assistance animals. Charging pet-related fees for assistance animals violates fair housing law.</p>

      <p><strong>Verification:</strong> For emotional support animals, housing providers may request reliable documentation that: (1) the individual has a disability, and (2) the animal provides assistance related to the disability. Verification should come from qualified healthcare providers (physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed counselors, etc.) with knowledge of the individual's disability.</p>

      <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Even with legitimate assistance animals, housing providers can deny requests if: the specific animal poses a direct threat to safety that cannot be eliminated through reasonable accommodation, the animal would cause substantial physical damage to others' property that cannot be eliminated through reasonable accommodation, or accommodating the animal would constitute an undue financial and administrative burden or fundamental alteration.</p>

      <h4>Reserved or Accessible Parking</h4>
      <p><strong>Mobility Disabilities:</strong> Individuals with mobility impairments frequently request assigned or reserved parking spaces close to their units or building entrances, even when property policy assigns parking on a first-come basis or charges for specific spaces.</p>

      <p><strong>Other Qualifying Disabilities:</strong> Parking accommodations may be necessary for non-obvious disabilities such as conditions causing extreme fatigue, respiratory impairments, or conditions making walking long distances dangerous.</p>

      <p><strong>Limited Parking Complications:</strong> Properties with insufficient parking may face difficult decisions about reassigning spaces from existing tenants to accommodate disability-related requests. Generally, the provider must make reasonable efforts to accommodate, including reassigning spaces when necessary, but can deny requests constituting fundamental alterations.</p>

      <h4>Occupancy Limit Exceptions</h4>
      <p><strong>Live-In Aides:</strong> Individuals with disabilities may request occupancy limit exceptions to allow live-in aides (caregivers providing assistance with activities of daily living, medical care, or disability-related needs). Reasonable occupancy standards must yield to legitimate live-in aide accommodation requests.</p>

      <p><strong>Family Size and Disability:</strong> Some disabilities or treatments make having larger families necessary or result in fewer people per bedroom than policies typically permit. Blanket occupancy limits cannot override legitimate disability-related family size needs.</p>

      <p><strong>Verification:</strong> Providers can verify that the additional occupant is genuinely needed to assist with the disability, not simply a preference for more housemates. However, providers cannot dictate who serves as the live-in aide or impose unreasonable qualification requirements.</p>

      <h4>Physical Modifications</h4>
      <p><strong>Reasonable Modifications vs. Accommodations:</strong> While related, physical modifications differ from policy accommodations. Under FHA, tenants have the right to make reasonable modifications to their units at their own expense, while landlords must make reasonable accommodations to rules and policies at no charge.</p>

      <p><strong>Common Requests:</strong> Grab bars in bathrooms, wheelchair ramps, widened doorways, lowered counters, accessible appliance controls, visual alert systems, and other physical changes enabling individuals with disabilities to use their homes.</p>

      <p><strong>Restoration Requirements:</strong> Landlords can require tenants to restore modified units to original condition at lease end, except for modifications that don't affect future tenants' use (e.g., grab bars that could benefit future tenants with disabilities).</p>

      <p><strong>Common Area Modifications:</strong> When common areas require modifications, the property owner typically must pay for them as reasonable accommodations rather than requiring the requesting tenant to pay.</p>

      <h4>Service and Assistance Animal Policies</h4>
      <p><strong>Breed Restrictions:</strong> Blanket breed restrictions cannot be applied to assistance animals. Even if property policies prohibit specific breeds (pit bulls, German shepherds, etc.) for pets, these restrictions cannot apply to legitimate assistance animals absent direct threat specific to the individual animal.</p>

      <p><strong>Size/Weight Limits:</strong> Similarly, size or weight restrictions on pets do not apply to assistance animals. A property with a 25-pound pet limit must still accommodate a 100-pound service dog if legitimately needed.</p>

      <p><strong>Number Restrictions:</strong> While less common, some individuals may legitimately need more than one assistance animal. Evaluate these requests individually based on how each animal addresses disability-related needs.</p>

      <h4>Policy and Rule Exceptions</h4>
      <p><strong>Payment Timing:</strong> Individuals with disabilities may need modified payment schedules, alternative payment dates, or extended grace periods to accommodate disability-related challenges managing finances or receiving disability benefits.</p>

      <p><strong>Communication Methods:</strong> Those with hearing, vision, speech, or cognitive impairments may need alternative communication methods (text instead of phone calls, certified mail to ensure receipt, extra time to respond to notices, documents in alternative formats).</p>

      <p><strong>Guest Policies:</strong> Some disabilities necessitate more frequent visitors (healthcare providers, family caregivers, therapy providers) than guest policies might otherwise permit. Reasonable accommodation requires flexibility in such circumstances.</p>

      <h3>Evaluating Accommodation Requests</h3>
      <p>Systematic evaluation ensures legal compliance while protecting provider interests:</p>

      <h4>Step 1: Receive and Document Request</h4>
      <p><strong>No Magic Words Required:</strong> Requests need not use terms like "reasonable accommodation" or cite the Fair Housing Act. Any request to modify rules or policies due to disability should be treated as an accommodation request.</p>

      <p><strong>Written or Oral:</strong> Requests can be oral or written. While written requests provide better documentation, refusing to consider oral requests violates fair housing law. When receiving oral requests, document them immediately in writing.</p>

      <p><strong>Who Can Request:</strong> The individual with the disability, a family member, a representative with proper authorization, or a healthcare provider on the individual's behalf can make requests. Don't dismiss requests from advocates or attorneys as somehow improper.</p>

      <p><strong>Initial Documentation:</strong> Record the date, time, who made the request, what accommodation was requested, stated reason for the request, and any supporting documentation provided. Create a file for the request and all related documentation.</p>

      <h4>Step 2: Preliminary Assessment</h4>
      <p><strong>Disability Readily Apparent:</strong> Is the disability obvious or already known to the provider? If yes, skip disability verification and proceed to evaluating the nexus and reasonableness.</p>

      <p><strong>Nexus Readily Apparent:</strong> Is the connection between the disability and requested accommodation obvious? For example, the connection between mobility impairment and accessible parking is apparent; the connection between anxiety and an emotional support animal may be less obvious to laypeople.</p>

      <p><strong>Face of Request Reasonable:</strong> Does the request appear on its face to be potentially reasonable, or does it involve clearly unreasonable demands (converting entire building to accommodate one tenant, requests costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, fundamental alterations to property operations)?</p>

      <h4>Step 3: Request Verification if Needed</h4>
      <p><strong>When Verification Permitted:</strong> Verification can be requested when disability or nexus is not readily apparent from observing the person or the circumstances. Never request verification when disability and nexus are obvious.</p>

      <p><strong>Appropriate Verification Sources:</strong> Qualified healthcare professionals with knowledge of the individual's disability (physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed social workers, counselors). Internet certification websites offering to certify assistance animals without examining the individual typically don't meet this standard.</p>

      <p><strong>Permissible Verification Questions:</strong> You may ask whether the person has a disability, whether the requested accommodation addresses disability-related needs, and generally how the accommodation addresses those needs. You cannot ask for diagnosis, medical records, detailed medical information, or unrelated health information.</p>

      <p><strong>Verification Documentation:</strong> Acceptable verification typically includes a letter from a healthcare provider confirming disability and need. It should include provider's name, professional credentials, statement that the individual is their patient/client, confirmation of disability (without diagnosing), and statement that the accommodation is needed due to disability.</p>

      <p><strong>Timing:</strong> Allow reasonable time for individuals to obtain verification (typically 2-4 weeks), particularly if they need to schedule medical appointments. Demanding immediate documentation or imposing unreasonable deadlines violates fair housing law.</p>

      <h4>Step 4: Interactive Process</h4>
      <p><strong>Dialog Encouraged:</strong> Fair housing law encourages interactive discussion between housing providers and individuals requesting accommodation to identify effective accommodations acceptable to both parties.</p>

      <p><strong>Alternative Accommodations:</strong> If the requested accommodation is unreasonable, explore whether alternative accommodations would effectively address the disability-related need. For example, if the requested parking space is unavailable, is there an alternative accessible space?</p>

      <p><strong>Clarification:</strong> If the request is unclear or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions rather than denying. Good-faith efforts to understand and accommodate requests demonstrate compliance and reduce litigation risk.</p>

      <p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Document all interactive process communications, including meetings, phone calls, correspondence, and any agreements or alternatives discussed.</p>

      <h4>Step 5: Reasonableness Determination</h4>
      <p>Evaluate whether granting the request would:</p>

      <p><strong>Undue Financial and Administrative Burden:</strong> This is a high bar—the accommodation must impose significant difficulty or expense relative to the provider's overall resources, not just the individual property. Factors include the accommodation's cost, the provider's overall financial resources, benefits to the requester, and availability of alternative funding.</p>

      <p><strong>Fundamental Alteration:</strong> Would the accommodation fundamentally alter the nature of the provider's operations or the property? For example, requiring a landlord to provide 24-hour medical care or converting a residential property to a medical facility might constitute fundamental alterations. Most ordinary requests do not.</p>

      <p><strong>Direct Threat to Safety:</strong> Does the specific individual (or assistance animal) pose a direct threat to others' health or safety that cannot be eliminated through reasonable accommodation? This must be based on objective, individualized assessment of actual risk, not assumptions, stereotypes, or fear.</p>

      <p><strong>Substantial Physical Damage:</strong> Would the accommodation result in substantial physical damage to others' property that cannot be eliminated through other reasonable accommodations? Again, this requires objective evidence specific to the situation, not speculation.</p>

      <h4>Step 6: Respond in Writing</h4>
      <p><strong>Approval:</strong> If approving, confirm in writing what accommodation is being granted, any conditions or requirements (if appropriate), effective date, and process for implementing the accommodation. Keep the tone positive and accommodating.</p>

      <p><strong>Denial:</strong> If denying, provide written explanation citing specific reasons and legal basis. Denials are rare and should be reviewed by legal counsel before issuance. Consider offering alternative accommodations if the requested one is truly unreasonable.</p>

      <p><strong>Timing:</strong> Respond within reasonable time, typically within 10-14 days of receiving complete information. Delays without justification can constitute denial and violate fair housing law.</p>

      <p><strong>No Fees:</strong> Never charge fees for processing, approving, or implementing reasonable accommodations. This includes application fees, administrative fees, pet fees, pet deposits, or increased rent due to accommodations.</p>

      <h3>Common Mistakes and Violations</h3>
      <p>Avoid these frequent errors that lead to fair housing complaints and lawsuits:</p>

      <h4>Documentation and Verification Errors</h4>
      <p><strong>Demanding Medical Records:</strong> Requesting complete medical records, diagnoses, or detailed medical information exceeds permissible verification. You only need confirmation of disability and need, not detailed medical history.</p>

      <p><strong>Online Certification Rejection:</strong> While skepticism about online assistance animal registries is reasonable, blanket rejection of all online documentation can be problematic. Evaluate documentation based on whether it comes from a legitimate healthcare provider with knowledge of the individual's disability, not the format.</p>

      <p><strong>Requiring Specific Forms:</strong> You can provide forms to streamline verification, but cannot require use of your specific form if the requester provides equivalent information in another format.</p>

      <p><strong>Unnecessary Verification Requests:</strong> Requesting verification when disability and nexus are readily apparent wastes time and can constitute harassment or discrimination. If you can see someone uses a wheelchair and they request accessible parking, verification is unnecessary.</p>

      <h4>Assistance Animal Errors</h4>
      <p><strong>Charging Pet Fees:</strong> Assistance animals are not pets. Charging pet deposits, pet fees, pet rent, or additional security deposits for assistance animals violates fair housing law. Providers can charge for actual damage caused (just like any tenant damage), but not preventive fees.</p>

      <p><strong>Breed Restrictions:</strong> Applying blanket breed restrictions to assistance animals violates fair housing law. Evaluate each animal individually based on that specific animal's behavior and any direct threat it poses.</p>

      <p><strong>Size/Weight/Species Limits:</strong> Pet restrictions on size, weight, or species don't apply to assistance animals. Properties must accommodate legitimate assistance animals regardless of these characteristics.</p>

      <p><strong>Imposing Pet Rules:</strong> Assistance animals are not subject to pet rules like leash requirements in units, restrictions on common area access, or prohibitions on animals in amenity areas (though public health codes may limit animals in food preparation areas or pools).</p>

      <h4>Process Errors</h4>
      <p><strong>Ignoring Requests:</strong> Failing to respond to accommodation requests, taking excessive time to respond, or requiring multiple follow-ups to get answers can constitute constructive denial.</p>

      <p><strong>Automatic Denials:</strong> Blanket policies denying all emotional support animals, all accommodation requests of certain types, or all requests from certain disability categories violate fair housing law. Evaluate each request individually.</p>

      <p><strong>Retaliation:</strong> Taking adverse action against individuals who request accommodations (denying renewal, imposing stricter enforcement, filing nuisance evictions) can constitute illegal retaliation.</p>

      <p><strong>Charging Fees:</strong> Charging any fees for processing, approving, or implementing reasonable accommodations violates fair housing law, even if characterized as "administrative fees" rather than denied accommodation.</p>

      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <p><strong>Can I verify someone's disability if they have an assistance animal?</strong><br>If the disability or need for the animal is not readily apparent, yes, you may request reliable verification from a qualified healthcare provider. However, you cannot require verification when the disability or need is obvious (e.g., blind person with guide dog).</p>

      <p><strong>Can I deny an accommodation request if it's too expensive?</strong><br>Only if the cost constitutes an "undue financial and administrative burden"—a very high standard considering your overall resources, not just the individual property. Most ordinary accommodation requests don't meet this threshold. Consult an attorney before denying on cost grounds.</p>

      <p><strong>Do I have to allow multiple assistance animals?</strong><br>Evaluate requests for multiple animals individually. If the person has disabilities requiring multiple animals (e.g., psychiatric service dog and emotional support cat addressing different disability needs), you likely must accommodate both unless doing so would be unreasonable.</p>

      <p><strong>Can I require renters insurance for assistance animals?</strong><br>This is legally uncertain. Some courts have held that requiring insurance specifically for assistance animals violates fair housing law because it imposes additional burdens on people with disabilities. General renters insurance requirements applied to all tenants are likely permissible.</p>

      <p><strong>What if the assistance animal causes damage or disturbs neighbors?</strong><br>You can hold tenants responsible for actual damage caused by assistance animals just like any other tenant damage, and can take action if the animal's behavior constitutes a direct threat to safety or substantial property damage. However, you must address specific behavior issues, not remove the animal preemptively.</p>

      <p><strong>Can I ask what tasks a service animal performs?</strong><br>For service animals under ADA in public accommodations, you can only ask: (1) Is this a service animal required because of a disability? and (2) What work or task has the animal been trained to perform? You cannot ask about the person's disability or require demonstration of tasks. FHA verification for housing may be slightly more detailed when disability or need is not apparent.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Reasonable accommodation obligations represent a critical fair housing responsibility requiring careful attention, proper procedures, and genuine commitment to equal housing opportunity. While the legal landscape can seem complex and daunting, systematic evaluation processes, good-faith efforts to accommodate, and focus on individual circumstances will guide you toward compliance.</p>

      <p>Use our Reasonable Accommodation Request Analyzer to evaluate requests systematically, ensure you're gathering appropriate verification, and document your decision-making process. This documentation protects you legally while ensuring you're meeting your obligations to individuals with disabilities.</p>

      <p>When in doubt, consult with a fair housing attorney or contact HUD for guidance. The cost of legal consultation is minimal compared to the potential cost of fair housing violations, which can include civil penalties, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorney fees, and lasting damage to your reputation and business.</p>

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
         SPECIFIC GUIDANCE BY REQUEST TYPE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

${requestType === 'assistance-animal' ? `
ASSISTANCE ANIMAL REQUEST ANALYSIS

Type: Likely ${disabilityApparent === 'apparent' ? 'Service Animal' : 'Emotional Support Animal'}

Key Requirements:
✓ NO pet fees, deposits, or rent allowed
✓ NO breed, size, or weight restrictions apply
✓ NO species restrictions (can be animals other than dogs for ESA)
✓ Animal must be under control and housebroken
✓ Tenant liable for actual damage caused

Verification Needed (for ESA only if not apparent):
□ Confirmation of disability from healthcare provider
□ Statement that animal provides disability-related assistance
□ Provider must have personal knowledge of individual's disability

Common Mistakes to AVOID:
✗ Charging any pet-related fees
✗ Applying blanket breed restrictions
✗ Requiring specific training certifications for ESA
✗ Accepting only your preferred documentation format
✗ Demanding diagnosis or medical records
✗ Imposing pet rules on assistance animals

Can Deny If:
• Specific individual animal poses direct threat (not breed assumptions)
• Animal would cause substantial property damage (with evidence)
• Accommodation would be fundamental alteration or undue burden
` : ''}

${requestType === 'parking' ? `
PARKING ACCOMMODATION REQUEST ANALYSIS

Common Scenarios:
• Mobility impairments requiring close parking
• Conditions causing fatigue or difficulty walking
• Respiratory conditions affected by weather exposure
• Need for covered parking due to medical equipment

Reasonable Accommodations May Include:
• Assigning specific accessible space
• Creating accessible space if none exists
• Reassigning existing tenant's space if necessary
• Allowing parking in areas normally restricted

Cost Considerations:
• Striping/creating accessible space: $500-2,000
• Generally considered reasonable
• Cannot charge tenant for accommodation

May NOT Need to Accommodate If:
• Property has no parking at all (can't create fundamental change)
• All accessible spaces already assigned to other disabled tenants
• Would require substantial property renovation
` : ''}

${requestType === 'occupancy' ? `
OCCUPANCY LIMIT EXCEPTION ANALYSIS

Common Scenarios:
• Live-in aide needed for disability-related care
• Medical equipment requiring additional space
• Service animals or therapy animals (in addition to assistance animals)
• Family size related to disability or treatment

Key Considerations:
✓ Legitimate live-in aide requests must be granted
✓ Cannot dictate who serves as aide
✓ Cannot impose unreasonable qualification requirements
✓ Aide need not be professional caregiver

Verification Should Confirm:
• Additional occupant needed due to disability
• How additional person addresses disability-related needs
• General nature of assistance provided

Cannot Deny Based On:
• Preference for professional vs. family caregiver
• Belief that applicant doesn't "need" full-time aide
• Concerns about exceeding typical occupancy ratios
` : ''}

${requestType === 'physical-modification' ? `
PHYSICAL MODIFICATION REQUEST ANALYSIS

Important Distinction:
• MODIFICATIONS (physical changes): Tenant pays, landlord permits
• ACCOMMODATIONS (policy changes): Landlord provides at no cost
• Common area modifications: Usually landlord's expense

Tenant-Paid Modifications (Private Unit):
• Tenant pays for installation
• Landlord can require professional installation
• Landlord can require restoration at move-out (except modifications useful to future disabled tenants)
• Cannot charge fees for permission

Landlord-Paid Modifications (Common Areas):
• Landlord typically must pay
• Covered as reasonable accommodation, not modification
• Cost considered under "undue burden" standard

Examples:
• Grab bars in tenant's bathroom: Tenant pays (can require restoration)
• Ramp to building entrance: Landlord pays (reasonable accommodation)
• Widening tenant's doorways: Tenant pays (may not require restoration if accessible doorways benefit future tenants)

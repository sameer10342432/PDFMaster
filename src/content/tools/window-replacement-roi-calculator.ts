    <h2>Why Replace Your Windows?</h2>
    <p>Window replacement is one of the most impactful home improvements you can make, offering benefits from energy savings to increased home value, enhanced curb appeal, and improved comfort. According to Remodeling Magazine's Cost vs. Value Report, window replacement typically recoups 70-80% of the cost at resale, while also providing immediate energy savings that can reduce heating and cooling costs by 15-30%.</p>

    <h3>Types of Replacement Windows</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vinyl Windows:</strong> Most affordable option ($300-$700 per window installed) - low maintenance, energy efficient, variety of styles. Lifespan 20-40 years.</li>
      <li><strong>Wood Windows:</strong> Premium aesthetic ($700-$1,200 per window) - traditional look, excellent insulation, requires maintenance. Lifespan 30+ years with care.</li>
      <li><strong>Fiberglass Windows:</strong> High performance ($500-$1,000 per window) - extremely durable, best energy efficiency, minimal maintenance. Lifespan 40+ years.</li>
      <li><strong>Aluminum Windows:</strong> Modern and sleek ($400-$800 per window) - strong frames, minimal sightlines, less energy efficient. Lifespan 20-30 years.</li>
      <li><strong>Composite Windows:</strong> Engineered materials ($600-$1,100 per window) - combines wood aesthetics with low maintenance, good insulation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Window Replacement Cost Breakdown</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standard Double-Hung Vinyl:</strong> $300-$600 per window installed for quality mid-range windows.</li>

      <li><strong>Wood Windows:</strong> $700-$1,200+ per window - varies by wood species (pine cheaper, mahogany expensive).</li>
      <li><strong>Bay or Bow Windows:</strong> $1,500-$3,500 installed - large complex installations with structural considerations.</li>
      <li><strong>Picture Windows:</strong> $400-$1,000 - fixed windows, no operating mechanisms, energy efficient.</li>
      <li><strong>Casement Windows:</strong> $450-$850 - crank-out style, excellent ventilation and sealing.</li>
      <li><strong>Labor Costs:</strong> $100-$300 per window depending on complexity, access, and local labor rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Disposal & Trim:</strong> $50-$150 per window for old window removal, new trim, finishing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Energy Savings from New Windows</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Heating Cost Reduction:</strong> Save 15-25% on winter heating bills with modern double or triple-pane windows vs old single-pane.</li>
      <li><strong>Cooling Cost Reduction:</strong> Save 10-20% on summer AC costs with Low-E coatings that reflect heat.</li>
      <li><strong>Annual Savings:</strong> Typical household saves $200-$500/year on energy bills - varies by climate, home size, window count.</li>
      <li><strong>ENERGY STAR Certification:</strong> Look for ENERGY STAR windows meeting climate zone requirements for maximum savings.</li>
      <li><strong>Utility Rebates:</strong> Many utilities offer $25-$100 per window rebates for ENERGY STAR installations.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax Credits:</strong> Federal energy tax credit available (up to $600 total for windows in 2023) - check current IRS guidelines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Home Value Increase from New Windows</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resale Value:</strong> Recoups 70-80% of cost nationally - higher in energy-conscious markets like Pacific Northwest, Northeast.</li>
      <li><strong>Curb Appeal:</strong> New windows dramatically improve exterior appearance, attracting buyers and increasing perceived value.</li>
      <li><strong>Buyer Preference:</strong> Most homebuyers prefer move-in ready homes with recent updates - windows are highly visible.</li>
      <li><strong>Appraisal Impact:</strong> Appraisers consider window quality, energy efficiency, and condition in valuations.</li>
      <li><strong>Faster Sale:</strong> Homes with new windows often sell faster than comparable homes with old windows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Additional Benefits Beyond ROI</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Noise Reduction:</strong> Double and triple-pane windows reduce outside noise by 50-70% - valuable near busy roads, airports.</li>
      <li><strong>UV Protection:</strong> Low-E coatings block 99% of UV rays, protecting furniture, flooring, artwork from fading.</li>
      <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Eliminate drafts, cold spots near windows, condensation issues - more consistent indoor temperatures.</li>
      <li><strong>Easy Operation:</strong> New windows open/close smoothly, improving ventilation and emergency egress.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> Vinyl and fiberglass windows never need painting, resist rot and insect damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Modern locks and impact-resistant glass improve home security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Financing Window Replacement</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Home Equity Loan:</strong> Borrow against home equity at fixed rate (currently 8-10%) - interest may be tax deductible.</li>
      <li><strong>HELOC:</strong> Home equity line of credit with variable rates - flexible draws, interest-only payments available.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Loan:</strong> Unsecured loan for $10,000-$50,000 window projects - faster approval but higher rates (10-15%).</li>
      <li><strong>Contractor Financing:</strong> Many window companies offer 0% promotional financing for 12-24 months.</li>
      <li><strong>Credit Card:</strong> For smaller projects, take advantage of 0% intro APR cards (12-18 months) and rewards points.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash Payment:</strong> Pay cash for discounts - some contractors offer 5-10% cash discount.</li>
    </ul>

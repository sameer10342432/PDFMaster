### Energy Star ROI Calculator

**Input Your Situation:**
- Current appliance type: _______
- Current annual energy cost: $_______
- New Energy Star model cost: $_______
- Standard model cost: $_______
- Price difference: $_______
- Annual energy savings: $_______
- Appliance lifespan: _______ years

**Calculate ROI:**
- Payback period = Price Difference ÷ Annual Savings
- Lifetime savings = Annual Savings × Lifespan
- Net profit = Lifetime Savings - Price Difference
- ROI % = (Net Profit ÷ Price Difference) × 100

**Decision:**
- Payback < 5 years: Excellent investment
- Payback 5-10 years: Good investment
- Payback > 10 years: Consider other factors

Energy Star appliances provide the best ROI when replacing old inefficient units, especially for high-energy products like water heaters, HVAC systems, and washers. Combined with behavioral changes (cold water washing, air drying), the savings compound significantly over time.

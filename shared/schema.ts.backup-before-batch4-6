## What is PDF Interleaving?

PDF interleaving arranges pages from multiple documents in alternating sequences. For example, taking page 1 from PDF A, then page 1 from PDF B, then page 2 from PDF A, and so on. This creates a unified document with content from different sources perfectly synchronized.

## Common Uses for Interleaved PDFs

Interleaving is particularly valuable for:
- Creating bilingual documents with original and translation on facing pages
- Building comparison documents showing before and after versions
- Producing study materials with questions and answers on alternating pages
- Developing training guides with instruction pages alternating with practice exercises

## Flexible Interleaving Patterns

Our tool supports various interleaving patterns beyond simple 1:1 alternation. Create custom ratios like 2:1 or 3:2 to match your specific document needs. The tool handles PDFs with different page counts gracefully, ensuring all content is preserved.

## Professional Quality Output

Interleaved PDFs maintain the original quality of all source documents. Text remains searchable, images stay crisp, and all formatting is preserved. The resulting document is fully compatible with standard PDF readers and professional printing services.`,

- Creating page-by-page presentations
- Removing and isolating specific content
- Building new documents from selected pages

## Selective Page Breaking

Choose exactly which pages to break out from your PDF. Extract pages 2, 5, and 9 as separate files, or break out page ranges like 10-15. Complete flexibility in how you break apart your documents.

## Quality Preservation

Each broken PDF page maintains full quality with all fonts, images, and formatting intact. The resulting individual PDFs are ready to use, share, or combine with other documents as needed.`,

## Why Split PDFs by Size?

Many platforms impose file size limits:
- Email attachments typically limited to 10-25MB
- Upload forms with maximum file size restrictions
- Mobile device storage optimization
- Cloud storage quota management

## Intelligent Size-Based Splitting

Our tool analyzes your PDF and intelligently determines where to split it to create files that fit within your specified size limit. The algorithm ensures:
- Each split file stays under the size threshold
- Page content is never cut off mid-page
- Optimal number of pages per split
- Minimal number of resulting files

## Flexible Size Options

Choose from common size presets (5MB, 10MB, 25MB) or set custom file size limits to match your specific requirements. Perfect for ensuring your files meet any platform's upload restrictions.

## Maintain Document Quality

Size-based splitting doesn't compress or reduce quality. The tool simply divides pages into multiple files, each maintaining the original PDF quality while staying within your size constraints.`,

When a PDF has bookmarks, splitting by them creates naturally organized sections:
- Each top-level bookmark becomes a separate file
- Chapters and sections automatically separated
- Maintains document hierarchy and organization
- Perfect for long documents with clear structure

## Common Use Cases

Bookmark-based splitting is ideal for:
- Extracting individual chapters from books or manuals
- Separating technical documentation sections
- Breaking apart compiled reports into components
- Creating individual files from multi-section documents

## Flexible Bookmark Level Selection

Choose which bookmark level to use for splitting. Split at top-level bookmarks only, or go deeper into the hierarchy to create more granular separations based on subsections.

## Preserve Navigation Structure

Each split file retains its internal bookmark structure, so subsections within a chapter remain navigable even after splitting the main document.`,

## Why Extract Odd Pages?

Odd page extraction is essential for:
- Duplex printing troubleshooting (printing odd pages first)
- Separating front-facing pages in scanned documents
- Creating alternate versions of documents
- Working with specific page sequences

## Automatic Odd Page Detection

The tool automatically identifies all odd-numbered pages in your document:
- Extracts pages 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.
- Maintains original page order in output
- Works with documents of any length
- Preserves all page content and quality

## Duplex Printing Support

Perfect for manual duplex printing workflows. Print odd pages first, flip the paper stack, then print even pages to create two-sided documents on printers without automatic duplex capability.

## Complement with Even Pages

Use alongside the "Split PDF Even Pages" tool to create two separate files—one with odd pages, one with even—for complete page separation and specialized document processing.`,

## When to Extract Even Pages

Even page extraction is useful for:
- Second pass of duplex printing workflows
- Separating back-facing pages in scanned documents
- Creating complementary document versions
- Specialized page processing requirements

## Automatic Even Page Selection

The tool automatically identifies all even-numbered pages:
- Extracts pages 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.
- Preserves original page sequence
- Handles any document length
- Maintains full quality and formatting

## Duplex Printing Workflows

Essential for manual duplex printing. After printing odd pages, use even pages for the reverse side to create professional two-sided documents on any printer.

## Complete Page Separation

Combine with odd page splitting to completely separate a document into two files. Useful for specialized processing, printing workflows, or document reorganization tasks.`,

- Set one or both for layered security
- Different passwords for different purposes

## Encryption Standards

Modern PDF encryption:
- AES 256-bit encryption (strongest)
- AES 128-bit encryption (balanced)
- RC4 128-bit (legacy compatibility)
- PDF 2.0 encryption standards
- Industry-standard security

## Permission Controls

Restrict specific actions:
- Prevent printing
- Disable copying text
- Block editing and modifications
- Restrict annotation and comments
- Control form field filling
- Prevent page extraction

## Best Practices for PDF Security

Create strong protection:
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Minimum 12 characters recommended
- Mix letters, numbers, symbols
- Avoid personal information
- Different passwords for different files
- Store passwords securely

## Password Management

Secure password handling:
- Use password managers
- Never share passwords via email
- Separate user and owner passwords
- Document password locations
- Regular password updates
- Secure password recovery methods

## Compliance and Regulations

Meet security requirements:
- HIPAA for healthcare documents
- GDPR for personal data
- SOX for financial records
- FERPA for educational records
- PCI DSS for payment information
- Industry-specific regulations

## When to Password Protect

Protect these document types:
- Contracts and agreements
- Financial statements
- Medical records
- Tax documents
- Confidential reports
- Personal identification documents
- Intellectual property`,

## What is PDF Underlay?

Unlike watermarks that appear on top of content, underlay appears behind the document content. This makes it perfect for:
- Adding company logos as subtle backgrounds
- Creating branded letterhead templates
- Adding decorative backgrounds without interfering with readability
- Placing draft or confidential markers behind text

## Underlay vs Watermark

While watermarks appear over content and can sometimes obscure text, underlays sit behind everything making them ideal for backgrounds that shouldn't interfere with document readability. Underlays are particularly useful for creating professional templates where branding needs to be visible but not distracting.

## Professional Applications

Use PDF underlay for:
- Corporate letterhead templates
- Branded document backgrounds
- Security backgrounds for certificates
- Decorative elements for presentations
- Subtle branding without content obstruction`,
